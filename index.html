        <h2>About Adorned</h2>
        <p>After 8 years in Boulder, the Nomad Bead Merchant family is growing. We are excited to announce a companion jewelry store, Adorned, opening this April. Adorned will be located directly next to Nomad at 9th and Walnut (in a portion of the former Clutter space).</p>
        <p>We want a store that features the beautiful and unique jewelry from Boulder’s own local artists. Our goal is to pull together an eclectic sampling of different kinds of work for our customers. From pearls to peyote stitch, we are excited for this opportunity to see what the beading, silversmithing, creative Boulder community has to offer.</p>

        <h2>Join Us</h2>
        <p>We are looking for high-quality locally made jewelry to consign at Adorned. We are asking each artists to complete an application and submit a representative sample of the work they wish to put in the store for consideration to a jury of the owners for review. Items can range from $15 to $5000 dollars. We will seriously consider all submissions, and will try to provide useful feedback if we find we are unable to accept your work. Originality of design and quality of material and finish will be critical to a positive outcome. If you are interested in joining us please complete the Adorned Consignment Form. We will begin scheduling our reviews as of March 1.</p>

        <h2>Opening Party</h2>
        <p>Save the date - Adorned will have a grand opening this April. Please join us for drinks, desserts, and Boulder’s finest work. More details coming soon!</p>
