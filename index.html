        <h2>About Adorned</h2>
        <p>Boulderâ€™s premier bead store, Nomad Bead Merchants, is excited to announce a companion jewelry store, Adorned, opening this April. Adorned will be located directly next to Nomad, at 9th and Walnut. (in a portion of the former Clutter space).</p>


        <p>We plan a store that features beautiful and unique jewelry from local artists. Our merchandise will include an eclectic sampling of jewelry from artists working in many mediums. From pearls to peyote stitch, we are excited for this opportunity to see what our local creative community has to offer.</p>


        <h2>Join Us</h2>
        <p>We are looking for high-quality locally made jewelry to consign at Adorned. We are asking each artist to complete an application and submit a representative sample of the work they wish to put in the store for consideration to a jury of the owners for review.</p>
        <p>Items can range from $15 to $5000 dollars. We will seriously consider all submissions, and will try to provide useful feedback if we find we are unable to accept your work. Originality of design and quality of material and finish will be critical to a positive outcome. If you are interested in joining us please complete the Adorned Consignment Form. We will begin scheduling our reviews as of March 1.</p>

        <h2>Events</h2>
        <p>Grand opening redux - We know it won't snow in July! Meet the artists and see all their beautiful jewelry and gifts. Adorned features around 30 artists, mostly local. Join us as we celebrate the latest creative spot in Boulder!</p>
